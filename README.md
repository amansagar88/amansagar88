## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **data-driven problem solver** passionate about applying machine learning to real-world challenges.  
I love digging into data, discovering patterns, and building predictive models that actually work.  

### 🔬 **Core Competencies**

#### 🧹 Data Preparation & Wrangling
- Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers  
- Feature engineering and transformation for model readiness

#### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summaries, trend analysis, and pattern detection  
- Visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly

#### 🤖 Supervised Machine Learning
- Building classification and regression models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)  
- Model tuning using GridSearchCV, cross-validation, and performance metrics (Accuracy, F1, AUC)

#### 🧠 Unsupervised Machine Learning
- Clustering techniques: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN  
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA & t-SNE for high-dimensional data

#### 🔎 Model Evaluation & Optimization
- Cross-validation strategies to reduce overfitting  
- Interpretation of results through confusion matrix, precision-recall, ROC curves

#### 📈 Data Visualization & Communication
- Visual storytelling to communicate insights effectively  
- Interactive dashboards and insight reporting

#### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebooks, Git, GitHub, VS Code

### 📚 What I'm Currently Learning

I'm taking a structured and hands-on approach to deepening my skills as a Data Scientist. Instead of rushing through everything, I'm focusing on one area at a time while building practical experience along the way:

#### 🧮 Strengthening My Math Foundations  
- Revisiting key topics like linear algebra, probability, and statistics  
- Applying them directly in model building and interpretation

#### 📏 Hypothesis Testing & Statistical Inference
- A/B testing, t-tests, chi-square tests, confidence intervals  
- Drawing conclusions and supporting business decisions with statistical rigor

#### 🧠 Diving into Neural Networks  
- Starting with basic implementations using NumPy  
- Gradually moving into frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch  
- Exploring CNNs and RNNs as I build confidence

#### 🧪 Practicing Through Projects & Kaggle  
- Applying new knowledge on real datasets  
- Reproducing small-scale research ideas for deeper understanding

#### 🌐 Staying Curious  
- Following AI/ML thought leaders and staying updated on trends  
- Exploring topics like Explainable AI and ethical machine learning

🛤️ I believe in learning **one layer deeper**, not just wider.  
It’s a continuous journey — and I’m enjoying every part of it.
